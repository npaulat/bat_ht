### Estimate association between young (>50 My) TE accumulation in bats and species richess; association between putative HT diversity and species richness in bats.
  * Make a data matrix of presence/absence of the putative HT TE subfamilies per bat species, and one of young TE copies per bat species (bats_PA_tables_edited_v3.csv; bats_accumulation.csv)
  * To count descendents assigned to each tip of the bat phylogeny, run **tree_count_v2.R**
  * For putative HT element diversity vs species richness, run **brms_TE_v4.R**
  * For young TE accumulation (copies) vs species richness, run **brms_TE_cumu.R** then **brms_TE_cumu_x.R**
